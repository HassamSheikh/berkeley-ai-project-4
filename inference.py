             that the ghost appears in its prison cell, self.getJailPosition()

             checking if it has a noisyDistance of None (a noisy distance
             of None will be returned if, and only if, the ghost is
             captured).

          2) When all particles receive 0 weight, they should be recreated from the
             prior distribution by calling initializeUniformly. The total weight
             for a belief distribution can be found by calling totalCount on

        correct name of the variable that you have used to refer to the
        list of the previous positions of all of the ghosts, and you may
        need to replace "i" with the variable you have used to refer to
        the index of the ghost for which you are computing the new
        position distribution.

          2) getPositionDistributionForGhost(gameState, ghostIndex, agent)
              This method uses the supplied ghost agent to determine what positions
              a ghost (ghostIndex) controlled by a particular agent (ghostAgent)
              will move to in the supplied gameState.  All ghosts
